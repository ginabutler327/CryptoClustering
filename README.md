# CryptoClustering
Data Bootcamp Week 19 HW on Python and Unsupervised Learning
This homework was to try to predict cryptocurrency pricing using clustering via scatterplot and linear elbow curves.  
I found that the plots reflected the high volatility of the crypto market.  However, there were sharp points in the 
elbow curve at k value 4.  Also, the majority of the clusters overlapped between -1 and 1. There wasn't much of a 
pattern that could be used to predict price. 

I relied on Xpert Learning for syntax and referred to some of in class examples from Prof. Booth.
